# BT_Biplanes_src
## Source code of BT Biplanes

We are two guys from Яussia and we wanna port BT Biplanes to modern platforms. For this we need source code of the original game. In this repo we'll try to deobfuscate the decompiled code.

## Classes:
* BluetoothBiplanes –- entry point, calls b
* b — main class
* c — looks like font parser
* d — draws something
* e — player class
* f — bullet class
* g — draws something
* h — audio parser
* i — keyboard class
* ~~j — main BT class~~
* ~~k — audio player?~~
* ~~l, m — auxiliary BT~~
* ~~n — dummy class~~

## Resourses:
* ad*.png — obviously, ads
* f — main font (f.png — parsed)
* fzb, fzr — in-game digits fonts (fzb.png, fzr.png — parsed)
* r — some resourses (res/Assets — parsed. In r must be other resourses.)
* tg, tm, tt — strings (tg.txt, tm.txt, tt.txt — parsed)
