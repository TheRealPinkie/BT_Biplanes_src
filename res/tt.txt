Bang! Down you go honey!
You're new at this aren't you?
I'm not giving up you know!
Take that, bozo!
Wheee! I'm the greatest pilot ever!
You can't catch me!
I'm going to finish you soon.
You are no match for my mind.
Too easy. Why not give up?
Experience is everything in war.
Hrmph. I'll soon be ahead.
Time to pay, young whippersnapper.
Feeling deflated yet?
I'm gonna burst your bubble!
I'll float back to first in no time!
You'll never pop me!
Eat my flak, worm!
I eat pilots like you for breakfast!
Soon I will be the champion.
I'm going to SMASH you!
You pathetic creature!
You are no match for my might!
Heeh! I edge closer by the moment!
I will punish you for your insolence.
What's a maggot like you doing here?
Can't you see you cannot defeat me?
You see? I won't tolerate this!
Not long for you to live now, insect.
-BZZZ- PUNY FLESH-THING.
I SHALL -BZZZ- ANIHILATE YOU.
YOU'LL SOON BE ENDED -TZZ-
-click- TIME FOR TERMINATION
